## General Deductions:

* Incorrectly named/submitted source file (-8)
* Constraints not followed (-40% PER PROBLEM)
* Failure to execute due to syntax errors (-30% PER PROBLEM)

## Problem A (10 pnts):

### Points deducted : 0

* +1 if function name/parameters are correct
* +1 if return type is correct
* +3 Correctly loops over all pixels
  * -2 if this takes more than 30 seconds
* +3 Correctly modifies the values of each pixel (255 - x)
* +2 Test cases
  * -1 if 2-3 runtime errors need to be fixed before test cases work

## Problem B (10 pnts):

### Points deducted : 0

* +1 if function name/parameters are correct
* +1 if return type is correct
* +3 Correctly loops over all pixels
  * -2 if this takes more than 30 seconds
* +3 Correctly modifies the values of each pixel (pixel / average of list) 
* +2 Test cases
  * -1 if 2-3 runtime errors need to be fixed before test cases work

## Problem C (10 pnts):

### Points deducted : 0

* +1 if function name/parameters are correct
* +1 if return type is correct
* +1 Correctly loops over all pixels
  * -0.5 if this takes more than 30 seconds
* +2 Flips x and y axis
* +3 Correctly swaps pixels
* +2 Test cases
  * -1 if 2-3 runtime errors need to be fixed before test cases work

## Problem D (10 pnts):

#### Points deducted : 0

* +1 if function name/parameters are correct
* +1 if return type is correct
* +4 Checks correct neighboring pixels
  * -2 if this takes more than 1 minute
* +2 Correctly changes values
* +2 Test cases
  * -1 if 2-3 runtime errors need to be fixed before test cases work

## Grader Comment:

Nice work, as always!!! One thing to consider: In grayscale, do you need the last for loop? does "for m in range(1)" do anything?
